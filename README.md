# Splicing^Lab

A Google Colab notebook/web server for predicting tissue-specific splice site usage from a single sequence using Pangolin

Analyze your own sequence here: https://colab.research.google.com/github/xuebingwu/SplicingLab/blob/main/colab.ipynb

## User interface

## Input
A single sequence, DNA or RNA

## Output
Two figures and a table for predicted sites on both strands. Output files will be zipped and downloaded. See below the output when using ACTB pre-mRNA as input.
